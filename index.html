          My name is Heather Noyes and I currently work at FCCI Insurance Group
          as a Software Developer. I graduated from the Georgia Institute of
          Technology with a Bachelors of Science in Biomedical Engineering.
          After working in the medical field professionally after I graduated I
          determined it wasn't the career I wanted. About four years ago I put
          in the work to change my career and became a Software Developer using
          the skills that I learned from my Computer Science minor at Georgia
          Tech.
          <br />
          <br />
          Outside of work I have enrolled in a coding bootcamp that has enabled
          me to learn new technologies and practice those skills to create this
          portfolio. For hobbies I love to knit, cook, bake bread, and host
          events for my friends and family. I recently moved back to the Atlanta
          area from Sarasota, Florida and am enjoying the cooler weather with
          some Appalachian trail hiking.
