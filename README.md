# HNoyesPortfolio

## Description

This is a portfolio page that contains many of my projects and about me information. The motivation for this project was to practice advanced CSS skills in order to showcase an ever increasing project base as I learn new skills. I created an accessible and semantic HTML skeleton of my content and used things like flexbox within the stylesheet to create a mobile first compatible website.

With the ongoing completion of this project I fulfilled the following user acceptance criteria.

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

This project taught me how I can expect to potentially see websites as they come through in the real world and be able to edit the code base to bring it up to the standards of today. This is extremely important for accessibility standards as well as time to market for future edits if the website were to be worked on.

## Installation

1. Download all files within the main directory as well as the assets directory to your device.

2. Open the index.html file in your browser to view the website.

3. If future edits need to be made then the stylesheet can be found under ./assets/css/style.css. Any accompanying images can be placed in ./assets/images/ and any downloadable documents can reside in ./assets/downloads/.

## Usage

The following image shows the web application's appearance:
